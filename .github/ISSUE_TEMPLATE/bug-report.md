## Steps to replicate the issue

"it doesn't work" is not a bug report!

Be very concise! Say what you did on which screen!

1. I open app for the first time
2. I click through the **three splash screens**
3. I press on "Create Account" button on the **Create account screen**

Recorded video link: (optional - make one with the [Loom app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loom.android) )

## What do you expect to happen?

1. I am sent to a screen where I can create an account

## What actually happens

1. The button shows a spinner, and nothing else happens

## Your environment

- Operating system: Android 5.0
- Tonomy ID version: 0.1.6 (click [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=foundation.tonomy.projects.tonomyidstaging) on your phone)
